Frontend:
- implement toasts for feedback and error feedback for user
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify
- use something better looking than <input type='file' ...
- keyboard shortcuts/hotkeys
  - numbers for selecting familiarity options
    - 1 for the "I don't know this card at all" option, goes up to 6 from there
  - space should flip card
- have Create be the interface when a user wants to edit a deck
- "If I press new card I think it should automatically select the text box so I can start typing" - Hank Hellstrom

Backend:
- add robots file to disallow web scrapers (or something?)
- the override algorithm is wrrrrrrrrrrong
- show intervals next to card studying options
- optimize deleting decks. Account for large deck sizes. 
- automatically updating isDue field in Firestore (somehow...) instead of updating on retrieval
- should I deploy as a Node app and use a server, or deploy as a static app and use Cloud Functions?
- Once Owen incorporates, upgrade Firebase acc, remove Algolia calls on server, and uncomment Cloud Functions
- add Algolia calls for concept lists.
- implement structure necessary for a study history

Fullstack:
- TEACHER FEATURES
- handle different time zones
- look at owen and hank bug testing notes
- use a webpack solution better than copy-webpack-plugin
- implement pictures into the decks
- think of a more elegant solution to the new user's profile pic bug. (see Michael)
- deck and conceptlist have a bunch of duplicate code, could you merge them into one component...?
- refactor, refactor, refactor
  - refactor deck vs. conceptlist flow. Create.js
- run everything through eslint eventually (before pushing to production)
- implement pictures into the decks
