Frontend:
- make designs mobile-responsive
-	finish faq page
- why do these keys: [ ] \ freak out the text inputs?
- make icon keys (switch front/back, delete, etc) work for deck creation

Backend/fullstack:
- deploy as Node app for Product Day
- how to handle deletion of personal data when deck is deleted?
  - automatically clear out personal data after x time of unuse?
  - make separate root-level collections of cards and concepts for personal data.
    - each card and concept has userId, deckId, same cardId
    - use queries
- automatically updating isDue field instead of updating on retrieval
- should i deploy as a Node app and use a server, or deploy as a static app and use Cloud Functions?
- Once Owen incorporates, upgrade Firebase acc, remove Algolia calls on server, and uncomment Cloud Functions
- add Algolia calls for concept lists.
- implement structure necessary for a study history
- handle different time zones
- files to be handled:
  - font files ttf/TTF, url in css
  - images, url in css
  - images, src in html

Both:
- think of a more elegant solution to the new user's profile pic bug. (see Michael)
- refactor, refactor, refactor
  -refactor deck vs. conceptlist flow. Create.js
- run everything through eslint eventually (before pushing to production)
- implement pictures into the decks
