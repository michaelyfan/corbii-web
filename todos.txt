Frontend:
- implement toasts for feedback and error feedback for user
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify
  	- ************	we have the other alerts now? do we still need these?
- use something better looking than <input type='file' ...
- have Create be the interface when a user wants to edit a deck
- "If I press new card I think it should automatically select the text box so I can start typing" - Hank Hellstrom
- make profile settings option stick to bottom of side bar
- make footer stick to bottom of site
- fix search ui (is it working??)

Backend:
- determining signin flow with conceptlist and deck (which are pages that don't require signin, but use firebase.auth().currentUser) is wrong. Functional atm, but could cause problems down the line.
- add robots file to disallow web scrapers (or something?)
- implement new override algorithm once Owen and Hank think of it
- all the bugs with conceptlist :/
- show intervals next to card studying options
- optimize deleting decks. Account for large deck sizes. 
- automatically updating isDue field in Firestore (somehow...) instead of updating on retrieval
- should I deploy as a Node app and use a server, or deploy as a static app and use Cloud Functions?
- Once Owen incorporates, upgrade Firebase acc, remove Algolia calls on server, and uncomment Cloud Functions
- add Algolia calls for concept lists.
- implement structure necessary for a study history

Fullstack:
- TEACHER FEATURES
- handle different time zones
- look at owen and hank bug testing notes
- enforce timestamp ordering for cards
- use a webpack solution better than copy-webpack-plugin
- implement pictures into the decks
- think of a more elegant solution to the new user's profile pic bug. (see Michael)
- deck and conceptlist have a bunch of duplicate code, could you merge them into one component...?
- highly reusable title component
- refactor, refactor, refactor
  - refactor deck vs. conceptlist flow. Create.js
- run everything through eslint eventually (before pushing to production)
- implement pictures into the decks
